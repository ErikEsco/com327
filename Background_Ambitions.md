Erik Escobar-Ocon: Background and Ambitions

As noticed above, my name is Erik. Escobar is my father's last name, and Ocon is my mother's last name. My last name was hyphenated due to the fact that before I was born, my father would receive phone calls and mail intended for other individuals with the same name. So there may be a millions Erik Escobar's in the world, but I am pretty sure I am the only Erik Escobar-Ocon.

Now a little bit more of my background. I am from Evanston, IL. It is the first suburb north of Chicago. I went to Evanston Township High School. I decided to come to IIT because it had given me the best scholarship, and it had a major I wanted to pursue.
