	<h1>Background</h1>
	<p>As noticed above, my name is Erik. Escobar is my father's last name, and Ocon is my mother's last name. My last name was hyphenated due to the fact that before I was born, my father would receive phone calls and mail intended for other individuals with the same name. So there may be a millions Erik Escobar's in the world, but I am pretty sure I am the only Erik Escobar-Ocon.
	</p>

	<p>Now a little bit more of my background. I am from Evanston, IL. It is the first suburb north of Chicago. I went to Evanston Township High School. I decided to come to IIT because it had given me the best scholarship, and it had a major I wanted to pursue. This major was Computer Engineering. I have always been fascinated with computers. My first computer had Windows ME installed, had a dial-up connection, and yes, it did have Netscape Navigator on it. I switched out of computer engineering because circuits threw me off. I did not want to actually build computers, I wanted to program. After my second year, I knew I wanted to switch out, but I did not know if I wanted to either switch to computer science, or information technology management. I ultimately went with computer information systems, with an ITM minor. The best of both worlds. 
	</p>

	<p>My minor is Internet Application Development. It has to deal with website development, which is something I love, and see myself doing it for life. I did HTML in high school, so I had knowledge about it. All I needed, was to catch up with the modern technology, which IIT is good for. So far, I have learned PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, and a whole bunch more at my time at IIT. I can pretty much say, that I am ready to take on the world.
	</p>

	<h1>Ambitions</h1>
	<p>My ambitions are limitless. Everyone has a lot of ambitions in life. For one, I want to work in web development. Whether it is front end development or back end, it does not matter to me, but I do prefer front end just a little. My dream job would be to work for Google. That will happen one day. I guaruntee you. Just google my name in 10 years. My ambitions for this class are to continue learning the modern technology. I know this class will be helpful, which is why I decided to enroll. I want to learn the best way to create a website, depending on the standards implemented by the W3C. My ambitions for IIT are simple, finish school in December, with the best GPA possible, and having learned everything that I could. IIT has been a great place for knowledge. I just wish I would have known this sooner, rather than wasting my time with my first major. Oh well, life goes on. You live and you learn. 
	</p>

	<p>My ambitions for life are quite simple. I want to have a career with a great company, where the environment feels great. I would like to live in Evanston still, but specifically Downtown Evanston. If you have not visited it, you should. It is an amazing place. If I don't live in Downtown Evanston, I would like to live on the North side of Chicago. Lakeview or more north. Another ambition is to be married in about 4 years, with kids in about 6 years. Having a nice car is also a high ambition. I drive a crappy car now, but I know that one day I will have either my Audi or my BMW. So far, those are my ambitions in life. Of course I have more, but these are the ones that I want to definitely accomplish. 
	</p>

	<p>And yes, I unfortunately do have a Twitter. I hate Twitter. #Instagram all the way!
